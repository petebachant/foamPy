# foamPy

A Python package for working with OpenFOAM--not to be confused
with PyFoam. Basically, this is a collection of useful functions and scripts
I have written and want to have available for the sake of reproducibility.

## Installation

### With `pip`

    pip install foampy

### From source

Clone this repository, and in this directory run

    python setup.py install

## Usage

### Assessing the progress of an OpenFOAM run

In a case directory, run

    foampy-progress

For a PyQt GUI progress bar run

    foampy-progress-gui

## Development

To run tests, execute

    pytest
